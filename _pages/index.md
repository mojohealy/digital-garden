# Welcome! 

I am [Michael Healy](www.mojohealy.com), a careers and employability educator and PhD candidate at the University of Southern Queensland, Australia. 

This website is a summary of and elaboration on: [*Mapping graduate employability and career development in higher education research: A citation network analysis*](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03075079.2020.1804851?journalCode=cshe20). It was witten with with my doctoral supervisors [[Sara Hammer]] and [[Peter McIlveen]] and published in the journal [[Studies in Higher Education]]. It represents quite a big milestone for me, as it is my first first-authored research article and the first article of my PhD by publication portfolio to be published. 

### What is a mind garden? 
I have designed this website using a [template](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll) designed to support the creation of a [digital mind-garden](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up). A mind garden is a website that integrates elements of a notebook and a blog, where authors can "share seeds of thoughts to be cultivated in public". 

The starting point for this particular mind garden is my [published article](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03075079.2020.1804851). But as anyone who has ever published a scholarly article will tell you, it requires you to strictly, surgically prune your ideas and language. In this mind garden I'm able to restore some of the off-cuts, let some ideas grow shoots, and generally share some of the true character of my reading, writing, and thinking.

### Stroll around my mind garden: 
There is no specific way to read this website. You just need to click links to navigate as purposefully or as randomly as you please. You can also see the website presented as a graph, showing the links between each note, at the bottom of each page. 

The best way to get into the ins and outs of the article might be through the component parts of the title: [[mapping]] [[graduate employability]] and [[career development]] in [[higher education research]]: A [[citation network analysis]].
