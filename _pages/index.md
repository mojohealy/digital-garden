# Welcome! 

I am [[Michael Healy]], a careers and employability educator and PhD candidate at the University of Southern Queensland, Australia. 

This website is a [[mind garden]], a summary of and elaboration on [*Mapping graduate employability and career development in higher education research: A citation network analysis*](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03075079.2020.1804851?journalCode=cshe20), written with with my doctoral supervisors [[Sara Hammer]] and [[Peter McIlveen]] and published in the journal [[Studies in Higher Education]]. 

A mind garden is a website that integrates elements of a notebook and a blog, where authors can "share seeds of thoughts to be cultivated in public". In this mind garden I'm able to restore some of the off-cuts, let some ideas grow shoots, and generally share more of my reading, writing, and thinking.  

There is no specific way to read this website. You just need to click links to navigate as purposefully or as randomly as you please. You can also see the website presented as a graph, showing the links between each note, at the bottom of each page. 

The best way to get into the ins and outs of the article might be through the component parts of the title: [[mapping]] [[graduate employability]] and [[career development]] in [[higher education research]]: A [[citation network analysis]].
