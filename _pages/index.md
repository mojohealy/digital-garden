# Welcome! 

I am [Michael Healy](www.mojohealy.com), a careers and employability educator and PhD candidate at the University of Southern Queensland, Australia. 

This website is a summary of and elaboration on: *Mapping graduate employability and career development in higher education research: A citation network analysis*. it was witten with with my doctoral supervisors [[Sara Hammer]] and [[Peter McIlveen]] and published in the journal [[Studies in Higher Education]] in August 2020. It represents quite a big milestone for me, as it is my first first-authored research article and the first article of my [[PhD by publication]] portfolio to be published. 

### Read the article: 

You can read it here: [Mapping graduate employability and career development in higher education research: a citation network analysis](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03075079.2020.1804851). 

If you don't have access, you can get the author's original manuscript from [my website](https://mojohealy.com/publication/healy-etal-2020/). 

### Stroll around my mind garden of the article: 
There is no specific way to read this website. You just need to click links to navigate as purposefully or as randumbly as you please. 

The best way to get into the ins and outs of the article might be through the component parts of the title: 

[[Mapping]] [[graduate employability]] and [[career development]] in [[higher education research]]: A [[citation network analysis]].
