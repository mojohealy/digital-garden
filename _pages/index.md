# Welcome! 

I am [Michael Healy](www.mojohealy.com), a careers and employability educator and PhD candidate at the University of Southern Queensland, Australia. 

This website is a summary of and elaboration on the first research article published as part of my PhD by publication portfolio: [[Mapping graduate employability and career development in higher education]]. It's a little bit about the article itself, but equally it's a record of why, how, and for who I wrote it. 

There is no specific way to read this website. Start at the start and click on the links that interest you. Amble or stumble around as purposefully or as randumbly as you please.
