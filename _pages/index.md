# Welcome! 

This website is a summary of and elaboration on: [*Mapping graduate employability and career development in higher education research: A citation network analysis*](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03075079.2020.1804851?journalCode=cshe20). 

### Stroll around my mind garden: 
There is no specific way to read this website. You just need to click links to navigate as purposefully or as randumbly as you please. You can also see the website presented as a graph, showing the links between each note, at the bottom of each page. 

The best way to get into the ins and outs of the article might be through the component parts of the title: [[mapping]] [[graduate employability]] and [[career development]] in [[higher education research]]: A [[citation network analysis]].  

### Read the article: 
You can read it here: [Mapping graduate employability and career development in higher education research: a citation network analysis](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03075079.2020.1804851).
