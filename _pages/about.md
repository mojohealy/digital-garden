I am [Michael Healy](www.mojohealy.com), a careers and employability educator and PhD candidate at the University of Southern Queensland, Australia. 

This website is a summary of and elaboration on the first research article published as part of my PhD by publication portfolio: [[Mapping graduate employability and career development in higher education]]Mapping graduate employability and career development in higher education]]. It's a little bit about the article itself, but equally it's a record of why, how, and for who I wrote it. 

### What is a mind garden? 
I have designed this website using a [template](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll) designed to support the creation of a [digital mind-gardens](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up). A mind garden is a website that integrates elements of a notebook and a blog, where authors can "share seeds of thoughts to be cultivated in public". 

My starting point for this particular mind garden is my [published article](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03075079.2020.1804851). But as anyone who has ever published a scholarly article will tell you, it requires you to strictly, surgically prune your ideas and language. In this mind garden I'm able to restore some of the off-cuts, let some ideas flourish, and generally allow the true character of my research to reveal itself as a thicket of reading, writing, and thought.
