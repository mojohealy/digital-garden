From the beginning of this project, we knew the value of our the visualisation of the full citation network in demonstrating that the gap between [[graduate employability]] and [[career development]] is real.  The gap has been noted before, but ours is the first research to really put it under the microscope.

This view only shows the 100 articles with the most links: there are some other authors who make links between the two fields in the underlying networks. But nonetheless, the gap is clear and it's impossible to argue that it doesn't exist. 

We didn't argue that there was no work that bridges the gap. In fact, we highlight the fact that  the [[perceived employability]] cluster is in fact career development research which was recognised by [[CitNetExplorer]] as being more connected to graduate employability. We also note recent graduate employability research from several scholars - Baruch, Donald, Jackson, Monteiro, Okay-Somerville, and Tomlinson and their colleagues - that draws on contemporary career development research, mostly from the [[career orientations]] cluster. 

Having illustrated the gap, our job then became to argue that the gap is a problem and that it should be closed. We approached this by highlighting areas where the concerns of each field overlap, by warning of the risk of [[jingle jangle]], and by sharing our view that the two fields could be brought together in an integrative pedagogy of [[careers and employability learning]].
