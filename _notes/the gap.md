The gap between [[graduate employability]] and [[career development]] in scholarly research is the central premise of our article. The gap has been noted before, but ours is the first research to really put it under the microscope. 

From the beginning of this project, we knew the value of the article's Figure 1, the main visualisation of the full citation network.

This view only shows the 100 articles with the most links: there are some other authors who make links between the two fieldsin the underlying networks. But nonetheless, the gap is clear and it's impossible to argue that it doesn't exist. 

Our job then became to argue that the gap is a problem and that it should be closed. We approached this by highlighting areas where the concerns of each field overlap, by warning of the risk of [[jingle jangle]], and by sharing our view that the two fields could be brought together in an integrative pedagogy of [[careers and employability learning]].
