Vocational psychology, a sub-discipline of applied psychology, investigates how individuals make career decisions, pursue career goals, and overcome career challenges. It is one of two fields of scholarly research that we collectively described as [[career development]], along with [[I/O psychology]]. Ideally, vocational research is used to inform approaches to [[career development practice]], such as career counselling and career education. 

In both [Mark Savickas's 2001 survey]() of the field and [Nadya Fouad and Michael Kozlowski's 2019 update](), vocational psychology was noted as being a diverse and provincial field of research. Savickas described the field as an island, seperate from both the mainland of applied psychlogy and its related field of [[I&O psychology]]. Fouad and Kozlowski noted that the field's insularity impedes communication between theorists, researchers, and professionals in [[career development practice]], meaning that leading research does not inform practice as much as it should. 

For a broad overview of vocational psychology, take a look at some of the useful [[surveys]] of the field.
