title: higher education research 
--- 
Our article is based, for the most part, in the field of [[higher education research]], and views [[graduate employability]] as a subfield of it. This presented a bit of a challenge, as higher education research is famously open and unbounded in terms of who does it and how they approach it. 

Malcolm Tight has probably done the most to survey the full range of higher education research, with his book [*Higher Education Research: The Developing Field*](https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/Higher_Education_Research/f290DwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover) a good place to start. Tight and other scholars have described the field as not having strong boundaries, having little or no cohesion in terms of theory or methods, being open to researchers from any and all disciplinary backgrounds, and lacking cohesion among the research communities who work in it. 

 Bruce Macfarlane's [[higher education research archipelago]] was a facetious, but accurate effort at [[mapping]] the discipline. The seeds of our article were planted when we discussed where on Macfarlanes's map would we find [[graduate employability]] and noted that [[career development]] would be on a whole different map. In our discussion, we explain how [[graduate employability]] shares many of the characteristics of higher education research more broadly.
