title: graduate employability cluster
---

The largest [[clusters | cluster]] in the [[graduate employability]] citation network is one which is the most focused on graduate employability as we know it. Consisting of 336 articles, it addresses "factors that promote or constrain GE, including human, social, and cultural capital; perceived employability; and pre-professional identities". It also includes research on various pedagogical or strategic approaches to graduate employability.

This cluster, along with the [[perceived employability]] cluster, is where we some work that bridges [[the gap]] between [[graduate employability]] and [[career development]]. Several authors in this cluster – Baruch, Donald, Jackson, Monteiro, Okay-Somerville, and Tomlinson and their colleagues – cite career development research. 

We argued that graduate employability researchers could benefit from paying more attention to certain [[career development]] literature, in part to avoid the risks of the [[jingle jangle]] fallacy. But we also noted that career development scholars would be well-served to better contextualise their work in the socio-economic contexts, institutional, and curricular systems and cultures of [[higher education research | higher education]].
