[CitNetExplorer](https://www.citnetexplorer.nl/) is the tool that made this article possible. That's not to say that this is the only tool that could do the analysis and present the visualisations that we needed, there are many that can. What sets CitNetExplorer apart is its user-friendliness. I was able to create an early version the main citation map, so clearly showing [[the gap]], in about 20 minutes after first downloading CitNetExplorer.

Nees van Eck and Ludo Waltman, the creators of CitNetExplorer, have provided [detailed explanations of its functions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1751157714000662?via%3Dihub). 

Our process started with a Web of Science [[literature search]]. We exported the results as plain text files, and imported the files into CitNetExplorer. Then we applied the [[clusters]] tool. The first time we did this we ended up with very large clusters for [[graduate employability]] and [[career development]]. To get a more refined view of each, we applied the [[clusters]] tool again to just the articles in each of those large clusters. In the end, we had a total of 10 clusters, five in [[graduate employability]] and five in [[career development]].
