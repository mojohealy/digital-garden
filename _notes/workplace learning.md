*Workplace learning* is the smallest of the [[clusters]] in the [[graduate employability]] citation network. Consisting of 88 articles, work in this cluster looks at the "graduate employability or academic benefits of placements, internships, and volunteering", with a good portion of that work looking at equity and accessibility as it related to internships and work experience. In addition to the research in this cluster, research on how students experience or benefit from workplace learning also appears in other graduate employability clusters, particularly the general [[graduate employability cluster]]. 

You can view the full list of articles included in this cluster in the [supplementary data file](https://srhe.tandfonline.com/doi/suppl/10.1080/03075079.2020.1804851/suppl_file/cshe_a_1804851_sm1489.xlsx).
