title: careers and employability learning
--- 

Our position is that [[the gap]] between [[graduate employability]] and [[career development]] research is a problem. The [[jingle jangle]] fallacy describes the risks that arise when two or more research communities work in parallel on common questions. Importantly, universities and their educators can't claim that they work from a robust evidence base if they do not adequately draw from both fields. 

We identified several researchers who have started to bridge the gap, introducing contemporary [[career development]] theory and evidence, mostly from the [[career orientations]] cluster, into their [[graduate employability]] work: Yehuda Baruch, William Donald, Denise Jackson, Silvia Monteiro, Belgin Okay-Somerville, and Michael Tomlinson and their colleagues. As yet, there is little or no exchange in the other direction. 

We use the term careers and employability learning to describe research and professional practice that integrates elements of both fields. This article has made an argument for an integrated approach in terms of scholarship. Likewise, my next article [[Who does employability?]] will address [[the gap]] and argue for a more integrated approach to careers and employability learning in terms of professional practice.
