title: perceived employability
---

Perceived employability is one of the more important [[clusters]] in the [[graduate employability]] literature. Consisting of 139 articles, it is concerned with "how individuals and particular groups subjectively perceive their own employability". It is important because is a key bridge over [[the gap]] between the [[graduate employability]] and [[career development]] citation networks. 

Although [[CitNetExplorer]] assigned the articles in this cluster to the graduate employability region of our research [[mapping]], they are in fact published in [[career development]] journals, [[I&O psychology]] journals in particular. This cluster also contains the highly influential work of [Mel Fugate and Angelo Kinicki](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvb.2003.10.005), proposing a psycho-social view of employability that added an important new perspective to graduate employability research. In addition, perceived employability has been taken up by those authors in the [[graduate employability cluster]] that we identified as bridging [[the gap]]: Baruch, Donald, Jackson, Monteiro, Okay-Somerville, and Tomlinson and their colleagues.
