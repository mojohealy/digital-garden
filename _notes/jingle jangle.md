Our [[citation network analysis]] illustated [[the gap]] between [[graduate employability]] and [[career development]] very clearly. But that in itself wasn't the point of our article, we needed to show why the gap was a problem and argue why efforts should be made to bring them closer together. 

One main reason [[the gap]] is a problem is the risk of the jingle jangle fallacy taking hold. [The jingle jangle fallacy describes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingle-jangle_fallacies) the issue of researchers in different academic fields using the same term to describe different concepts or using different terms to describe the same concept. 

Professional identity, for example, is the focus of an entire cluster of research in [[graduate employability]], but is also considered in a lot of [[career development]] research. Yet, scholars from one area don't cite those in the other and when you look closely, you see that the concept of professional identity looks quite different in each field. 

A more integrative approach to [[careers and employability learning]] can mitigate this risk, by making researchers and practitioners more aware of what is happening in the adjacent field and encouraging them to look for useful theory and evidence, rather than reinventing the wheel themselves.
