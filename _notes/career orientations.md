title: career orientations
---
*Career orientations* is the name we gave to a cluster of [[career development]] research that is focused on "how people envision their future working selves, including career adaptability, proactive attitudes and behaviours, protean and boundaryless careers, career optimism and hope, and work as a calling". It consists of 155 articles and is the cluster in which [[I&O psychology]] research has the greatest influence. 

This cluster provides several perspectives on how students experience change, become proactive and optimistic, and understand the meaning of their work. This cluster is where we see some evidence of reseach that closes [[the gap]], in the form of recent [[graduate employability]] research focused on the identities, perceptions, and dispositions of students. 

The work of [[Peter McIlveen]], one of the authors of *Mapping Graduate Employability and Career Development in Higher Education Research*, appears in this cluster. 

You can view the full list of articles included in this cluster in the [supplementary data file]().
