title: industrial and organisational psychology
---
Industrial and organisation psychology, is a sub-discipline of applied psychology focused on management and workplace practices enhance employee recruitment, engagement, satisfaction, and productivity. It is one of two fields of scholarly research that we collectively described as [[career development]], along with [[vocational psychology]]. Industrial and organisation research is often used to inform approaches to human resources management, professional development, and industrial relations, as well as [[career development practice]], such as career counselling and career education. 

In both [Mark Savickas's 2001 survey]() of career development and [Nadya Fouad and Michael Kozlowski's 2019 update](), industrial and organisational psychology was characterised as an island, seperate from both the mainland of applied psychlogy and its related field of [[vocational psychology]]. Fouad and Kozlowski noted that this insularity impedes communication between theorists, researchers, and career development practitioners. 

For a broad overview of the broader field of [[career development]], take a look at some of the useful [[surveys]] of the field.
