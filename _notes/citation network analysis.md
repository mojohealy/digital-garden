The method we used for our study was direct citation network analysis. Our data was all the articles that resulted from our [[literature search]] and our analysis amounted to drawing lines between articles that cited or were cited by each other. 

There have been plenty of citation analyses in [[higher education research]], several of them in [[Studies in Higher Education]], which probably helped our submission to that journal. There's also been a couple of citation analyses in the [[career development]] field. One of the contributions our study makes is the interdisciplinary focus, which is unusual. 

Our analysis was made easy by [[CitNetExplorer]], a nifty little tool that visualises direct citation networks and provides a range of analytical tools. Most crucial of these tools was the [[clusters]] function, which identifies groups of particularly connected articles. 

As you can see in the illustration bellow, the result of our direct citation analysis was a very clear visualisation of [[the gap]] between [[graduate employability]], on the left, and [[career development]], on the right, and the [[clusters]] within them. In addition to providing a stark illustration of our main argument, the cartographic look of the visualisations aligned elegantly with the [[mapping]] theories that we based our article on.
