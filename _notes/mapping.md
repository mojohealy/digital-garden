Mapping is a central concept in this article, both theoretically, as a way of making sense of fields of study, and methodologically, as a way of illustrating certain characteristics of the research. 

#### Mapping as theory
Several distinct geographic metaphors have been applied to [[higher education research]]: Sue Clegg's article [Conceptualising higher education research and/
or academic development as ‘fields’: a critical analysis](https://doi.org/10.1080/07294360.2012.690369) is a good overview. 

The metaphors that we drew on the most in this article are Tony Becher and Paul Trowler's notion of [academic tribes and territories](https://books.google.com.au/books/about/Academic_Tribes_and_Territories.html?id=N76dAAAAMAAJ) and Bruce Macfarlane's [[higher education research archipelago]]. 

We were fortunate that [Mark Savickas had used a similar metaphor](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0001879101918342), of [[vocational psychology]] and [[industrial and organisational psychology]] as islands within the broader field of [[career development]] that have little to do with each other. This allowed us to make an elegant connection between previous characterisions of the two fields we mapped in this study. 

#### Mapping as method
The method we used in this study, [[citation network analysis]], was useful in that it lends itself to visualisations that can resemble maps, as you can see from our citation network analysis visualisation below. We were able to draw on geographical metaphors to characterise the [[graduate employability]] and [[career development]] literatures and describe how they relate to each other. Most importantly, our maps made [[the gap]] between them crystal clear.
