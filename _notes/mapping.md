title: Mapping
---
Mapping is the central concept in this article, both theoretically, as a way of making sense of fields of study, and methodologically, as a way of illustrating certain characteristics of the research. 

### Mapping as theory
Several distinct geographic metaphors have been applied to [[higher education research]]: Sue Clegg's article [Conceptualising higher education research and/
or academic development as ‘fields’: a critical analysis](https://doi.org/10.1080/07294360.2012.690369) is a good overview. 

The metaphors that I drew on the most in this article are Tony Becher and Paul Trowler's notion of [[academic tribes and territories]] and Bruce Macfarlane's [[higher education archipelago]]. 

I was fortunate that Mark Savickas had used a similar metaphor, of [[vocational psychology]] and [[I/O psychology]] as islands within [[career development]] that  have little to do with each other. This allowed me to make an elegant connection between previous characterisions of the two fields I was mapping in this study. 

### Mapping as method
The method I used in this study, [[citation network analysis]], was useful in that it lends itself to visualisations that can resemble maps. I was able to draw on geographical metaphors to characterise the [[graduate employability citation network]] and [[career development citation network]] and describe how they relate to each other.
