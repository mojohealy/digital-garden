title: who does employability
---

*Mapping Graduate Employability and Career Development in Higher Education Research* the first publication planned for my PhD by Publication on the topic of [[careers and employability learning]]. The thesis, which will take the form of a publication portfolio with some additional narrative elements linking the publications, is planned to look like this: 

1. *Mapping Graduate Employability and Career Development in Higher Education Research*, published August 2020: uses [[citation network analysis]] as a tool for [[mapping]] the [[graduate employability]] and [[career development]] research literature, demonstrating [[the gap]].
2. *Who Does Employability in Austrlian Higher Education*, coming soon: an analysis of 377 job advertisement for careers and employability professionals in Australian universities from 2013 to now. Also looking at [[the gap]], but from a professional practice point of view. 
3. A collaborative autoethnography in partnership with a university educator and a student. Together we will evaluate a career writing exercise that I have developed as an example of an evidence-based, integrative pedagogy of [[careers and employability learning]] for higher education.
