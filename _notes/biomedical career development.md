title: biomedical career development
--- 

The smallest [[cluster]] of research in the [[career development]] is focused on [[biomedical career development]]. Consisting of 68 articles, it looks at the career development needs and influences of biomedical students and professionals, including evaluations of professional development and gender equity interventions. 

This cluster stands almost entirely apart from the rest of the [[career development]] network, as an island of its own on our [[mappping | map]], with just one link to Robert Lent and Steven Brown's [1994 article]() on [[social-cognitive career theory]]. 

Something that we noted about this cluster is that is an entirely different body of research to that looking at nursing students' [[professional identities]]. In this cluster, biomedical means doctors and surgeons.
