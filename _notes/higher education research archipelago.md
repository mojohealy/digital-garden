The seed of our article was sown early on in my doctoral work, when I read Bruce Macfarlane's article [*The higher education research archipelago*](https://doi.org/10.1080/07294360.2012.642846), which contains a famous map of all the different research topics within the breadth of [[higher education research]].

Graduate employability doesn't exist on Macfarlane's map and I started thinking about where I would place it. Our article answers that question. 

Because [[graduate employability]] is itself a diverse area of research, a single flag can't be planted in any one spot on Macfarlane's map. It appears GE in several locations on both  islands – policy and teaching and learning – and on some smaller islands, such as identity or institutional research.

On the other hand, we can't place [[career development]] on this map at all: it exists over the horizon of Macfarlane's map. Although a few scholars have been setting sail for foreign lands and beginning to articulate something we might call [[careers and employability learning]], it's clear that [[the gap]] real, and for now at least, it is vast.
