title: career development practice

Although our article focuses for the most part on [[vocational psychology]] and [[industrial and organisational psychology]] *research*, it's important to note that the professional practice of career development education and guidance is also a crucial part of [[career development]]. Indeed, within each of the career development [[clusters]] are research articles about how practitionars might the various theories and evidence can inform the work of helping people with their career decisions, goals, strategies, and challenges, or evaluating career development practice methods and techniques. 

We note the [abundant evidence](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-careers-employability-learning-matters-higher-education-healy/) that quality careers and employability learning, delivered by qualified experts, has strong positive impacts on students academic, careers, and employment outcomes. 

As [[the gap]] in our [[mapping]] exercise implies, there is a similar gap in the professional practice of [[careers and employability learning]] more broadly, with academics, teaching and learning specialists, and work-integrated learning specialists on one hand and university careers services staff on the other. As well as promoting greater integration of research, we hope that our article also promotes greater collaboration at the professional level. 

The next article in my PhD, [[Who does employability]] looks specifically at the professional practice part of this discussion.
