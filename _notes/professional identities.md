title: professional identities
---

*Professional identities* is the second largest of the [[clusters]] in the [[graduate employability]] literature. Consisting of 157 articles, his cluster is focused on the "development and expression of professional identities, frequently focused on teachers, nurses, or academics". The research in this cluster is relatively loosely connected to the broader graduate employability citation network, because it is more often published in discipline-specific education journals than [[higher education research]] journals.

In addition to the research in this cluster, professional identities is also a common theoretical approach in the general [[graduate employability cluster]], in large part because identity is central to Mel Fugate and Angelo Kinicki's [dispositional view of employability](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvb.2003.10.005), and has further been brought into discussions about graduate employability by scholars such as [Denise Jackson](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007%2Fs10734-016-0080-2), [Michael Tomlinson](https://doi.org/10.1080/03075079.2019.1659763), and [Leonard Holmes](https://doi.org/10.1108/ET-08-2013-0100).
