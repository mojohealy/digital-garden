title: career development barriers
---

*Career development barriers* is one of the five [[clusters]] in the [[career development]] citation network. It includes 98 articles related to "personal and social barriers to career success, particularly disability, mental illness, and marginalisation."
We suggest in our discussion section that this literature may be of interest to [[graduate employability]] researchers investigating equity in higher education.

It also includes research into careers services in higher education, because much of this research looks at how careers services support students' in overcoming career development barriers. 

Two authors of *Mapping Graduate Employability and Career Development in Higher Education Research*, [[Michael Healy]] and [[Peter McIlveen]], appear as authors in this cluster. 

You can view the full list of articles included in this cluster in the [supplementary data file]().
