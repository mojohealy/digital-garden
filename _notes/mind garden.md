title: mind garden

I have designed this website as a mind garden using a [template](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll) designed to support the creation of a [digital mind-gardens](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up). A mind garden is a website that integrates elements of a notebook and a blog, where authors can "share seeds of thoughts to be cultivated in public". 

My starting point for this particular mind garden is my [published article](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03075079.2020.1804851). But as anyone who has ever published a scholarly article will tell you, it requires you to strictly, surgically prune your ideas and language. In this mind garden I'm able to restore some of the off-cuts, let some ideas grow shoots, and generally share a little bit more of the true character of my reading, writing, and thinking.
