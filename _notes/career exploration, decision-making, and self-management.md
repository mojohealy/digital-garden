title: career exploration, decision-making, and self-management
---

*Career exploration, decision-making, and self-management* is the largest and most influential of the [[clusters]] of research in the [[career development]] side of our [[mapping]] of the research. Consisting of 386 articles, it looks at "factors related to career exploration, decision-making, and self-management, including career decision-making self-efficacy, adaptive career behaviours, career maturity, career self-management, career learning experiences, and career exploration."

A lot of the research in this cluster uses the [[social-cognitive career theory]] as a theoretical framework and the [career decision-making self-efficacy scale](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F106907279600400405) as a measure. 

In short, this cluster provides a wealth of well theorised and validated evidence about how people, particularly university students approach career decision-making, learn from experience, develop confidence in their prospects, and enact proactive career behaviours. The alignment of these concerns with those at the heart of [[graduate employability]] research are clear, yet there is very little exchange between them.
