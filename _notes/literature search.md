title: literature search

The first step of our [[citation network analysis]] was to search [Web of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_Science) for articles related to our topic. [[CitNetExplorer]] is optimised for Web of Science data files and while we recognise that different databases have different coverage, we were satisfied that a Web of Science search would privide an accurate result. 

We wanted to search for a broad range of work, so we used a number of words and phrases that we were confident would capture most of the relevant literature: “career development” OR “career decision” OR “career self-efficacy” OR “career exploration”
OR “career adaptability” OR “career maturity” OR “career planning” OR “career management” OR
employability OR “professional identity” OR “vocational identity” OR “graduate identity” OR “graduate
attributes” OR “graduate outcomes”. 

To make sure that the search only captured articles focused on higher education, we limited results to those including the terms: university OR “higher education”
OR college. 

We had to exclude one article which was included in the results because it had certain key words, but wasn't actually relevant. Similarly, we had to manually include two highly influential articles by [Mel Fugate and colleagues](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=n22UVIcAAAAJ&hl=en), which weren't specifically about higher education and so not included in the results. 

All in all, we ended up with 4,068 articles. Of those, 1,850 articles would be assigned to [[clusters]] by [[CitNetExplorer]].
