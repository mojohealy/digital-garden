title: graduate employability
--- 
Graduate employability research is part of the broader field of [[higher education research]]. It looks at factors which influence the career success of university students and characteristics. 

Broadly speaking, graduate employability researchers focus at three levels of analysis: socio-political systems, institutional strategies, and individual perceptions and experiences. 

There have been several [[surveys of graduate employability]] literature, but our article is the first, to my knowledge, to apply an empirical approach such as [[citation network analysis]]. 

Based on our analysis of the [[graduate employability citation network]], we were able to describe several of the specific [[clusters]] that made it up: the [[graduate employability cluster]]; [[professional identities cluster]]; [[graduate attributes cluster]]; [[percieved employability cluster]], and [[workplace learning cluster]]. 

We showed that graduate employability shares many of the disciplinary qualities of the broader [[higher education research]]. Equally importantly, our analysis proved what we and some others had noted in the graduate employability literature: that it did not include [[career development]] literature as much as you might expect. Demonstrating this gap is the first step in our argument for an integrated approach to [[careers and employability learning]].
