[*Studies in Higher Education*](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/cshe20/current) is a [leading](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=soc_highereducation) [[higher education research]] journal. 
I was aiming high by targetting this journal for my debut article, and very pleased to have it accepted. 

It wasn't good luck, but a great fit for the journal, on several counts. Firstly, much of the [[mapping]] literature that we draw on was itself published in [*Studies in Higher Education*]. Secondly, [*Studies in Higher Education*] has published a number of [[citation network analysis]] studies. Finally, and most importantly, [*Studies in Higher Education*] is a leading journal for quality [[graduate employability]] research, including much of the work that we highlight in our article for closing [[the gap]] between [[graduate employability]] and [[career development]].
