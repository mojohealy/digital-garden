[*Studies in Higher Education*](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/cshe20/current) is a [leading](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=soc_highereducation) [[higher education research]] journal. 
I was aiming high by targeting this journal for my debut article, and very pleased to have it accepted. 

I targeted this journal for a couple of reasons. Firstly, much of the [[mapping]] literature that we draw on was itself published in *Studies in Higher Education*. Secondly, *Studies in Higher Education* has published a number [[citation network analysis]] studies. Finally, *Studies in Higher Education* is a leading journal for quality [[graduate employability]] research, including much of the work that we highlight in our article as closing [[the gap]] between [[graduate employability]] and [[career development]] and beginning to form a more integrated view of [[careers and employability learning]].
