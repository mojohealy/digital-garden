In our article we didn't have the scope to describe specific theories [[graduate employability]] or [[career development]] that we observed from our [[citation network analysis]] in too much detail. If we had more space, we would have started with Robert Lent and Steven Browns's *social-cognitive career theory*, which we found to be by far the most influential theory in our data set. In fact, research using social-cognitive career theory made up the bulk of the [[career exploration, decision-making, and self-management]] and [[career decision-making difficulties]] clusters. 

Social-cognitive career theory was the result of an effort to unify foundational career development theories of career interests, decisions and goals, behaviours and attitudes, and learning experiences. Most importantly, it adopted Albert Bandura's [social cognitive theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_cognitive_theory), putting learning experiences and self-efficacy at the heart of the social cognitive career theory.

As shown in the illustration above (from Lent & Brown, 2019), the social-cognitive career theory holds that a person's learning experiences are strongly influenced by personal and contextual factors. Their learning experiences help shape their sense of how well they are able to complete certain actions (self-efficacy) and what they expect the outcomes of their actions to be (outcome expectations). The strength and clarity of their self-efficacy and outcome expctations then influences their career interests, decisions and goals, and actions. The relative success or failure of their actions then influences their self-efficacy and outcome expectations, in an iterative, lifelong learning process. 

In the years since social-cognitive theory was first proposed, it has been extensively tested and developed. It is perhaps the most developed theory of career learning in the field. So it is surprising, and a little disappointing, that [[graduate employability]] research has as yet, largely overlooked it. Social-cognitive career theory should be one of the key starting points if we want to develop a more integrated pedagogy of [[careers and employability learning]]
