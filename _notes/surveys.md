title: surveys

In writing our article, we used a number of useful surveys of both [[graduate employability]] and [[career development]]. Surveys are an excellent way to get an overview of the themes and trends in particular disciplines. They can include narrative reviews, systematic reviews, and [[citation network analysis]] studies like our one. 

Below are some of the surveys we cited in our article, as well as some others that we didn't.
