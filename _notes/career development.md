In our article, we use *career development* as an umbrella term for a combination of [[vocational psychology]], [[I&O psychology]]. Broadly speaking, it investigates psychological, cognitive, and behavioural characteristics that help or hinder people's career success. 

Although it shares many of the same overall concerns as [[graduate employability]], this work seldom shows up in graduate employability research. Our main motivation for writing this article was to illustrate [[the gap]] between the fields and argue for the value in bridging it. 

Our [[citation network analysis]], illustrated below, allowed us to map and describe specific [[clusters]] in this research: [[career exploration, decision-making,
and self-management]] (blue), [[career decision-making difficulties]] (yellow), [[career orientations]] (green), [[career development barriers]] (pink), and [[biomedical career development]] (brown).

The main body of this network is mostly [[vocational psychology]] research, while the [[career orientations]] cluster is where we see more [[I&O psychology]] research. In 2001, [Mark Savickas characterised](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0001879101918342?via%3Dihub) the two as unrelated islands, but in our article we demonstrate that peninsula is a more accurate [[mapping]] metaphor for the current relationship of I&O to vocational psychology. 

For a broad overview of career development, take a look at some of the useful [[surveys]] of the field.
