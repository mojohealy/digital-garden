title: career decision-making difficulties
---

The second largest [[cluster]] in the [[career development]] network is *career decision-making difficulties*. Consisting of 275 articles, it is in fact in large part an extension of the [[career exploration, decision-making, and self-management]] cluster, focusing specifically on "impediments to career decision-making and research into specific challenges, such as family influences or negative emotional states". 

As with the [[career exploration, decision-making, and self-management]] cluster, much of the work in this cluster uses the [[social-cognitive career theory]] as a theoretical framework and the [career decision-making self-efficacy scale]() as a measure. 

You can view the full list of articles included in this cluster in the [supplementary data file]().
